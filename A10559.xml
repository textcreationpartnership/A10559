         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Chriſt Church, the Congregation of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe hee onely is called in the holy Scriptures the Head of the Church. Saint Paul therefore for to have all things done<note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.40</note> decently and in order, did from the holy Ghoſt preſcribe that (whereas Chriſt is in the<note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 18.20.</note> midſt of two or three gathered together in his name) the gracious preſence of Chriſt ſhould be<note n="z" place="margin">Exod. 3.5.

               <hi>know</hi> (or by an outward ſigne to expreſſe forth) <hi>that the head of every man is Chriſt, and the head of the woman is the man. Every man therefore praying or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head. But every woman prayingor prophecying with her head unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, dishonoureth her head. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, foraſmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</hi> It may be demanded, How doth every woman pray and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie in the aſſemblie? They are required to keepe<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.34.</note> ſilence in the Churches. The holy Ghoſt then in the ſaid Chapter to the Corinthians ſpeaketh of ſuch a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12300:27"/>prophecying and praying of every woman, as of<note n="*" place="margin">See what Mr Samuel Hieron hath delivered concerning the reverence to be uſed in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods word preached, as it is rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this work where the duty unto God, <hi>the honouring of his word</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> every man in the ſame aſſembly: for it is there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered within one period concerning the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit of both ſexes in each of the worſhips of GOD, when wee ſpeake unto God, or when God ſpeaketh unto us. And the praying and prophecying which is to be performed by the whole congregation of men and women is onely by conſent unto the Prieſts perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of both Services. And becauſe conſent to the doing of any matter is accounted as the acting of it, therefore in like manner of ſpeaking it is ſaid in the booke of Kings,<note n="c" place="margin">1.

Wherefore alſo if the Prieſts now in their performing prayer and prophecying (or preaching) may not have on their heads their common upper covering, becauſe it is requiſite they ſhould ſhew reverence unto the preſence of JESUS CHRIST their Lord, ought not alſo the whole congregation of men, the learners, be habited ſo on their heads, as that there may bee from them ſome ſigne of reverence unto Jeſus Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as well as the women are to have on their heads in the Church ſome ſigne of their ſubjection unto the man? And therefore the holy Apoſtolicall Church of England knowing that Chriſt is in every aſſembly of the Saints, and that hee looketh for bodily worſhip from all people of both ſexes, ſhe tendering the glory of her head Chriſt, that during all the time whiles his gracious preſence is among his people, it may bee by ſome outward<note n="*" place="margin">Worſhip the Lord in the beauty of holineſſe.

But yet thoſe perſons which did crucify him, did it with wicked hands and hearts, as <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame<note n="r" place="margin">Act. 2.23.</note> verſe ſignifieth.

Wherefore though Chriſt was not delivered into his enemies hands without his Fathers determinate counſell, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and ſufferance; yet the delivering of him by Judas Iſcariot into the Jewes hands, was very great ſinne. And this doth Chriſt himſelfe teſtifie, when as Pilate ſaid unto him, Knoweſt thou not, that I have power to crucifie thee, and I have power to releaſe thee? Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt mee, except it were given thee from above: therefore hee that<note n="w" place="margin">Ioh. 19.11.</note> delivered mee unto thee, hath the greater ſinne.</p>

Alſo when the time of his ſuffering came, God ſo ruled the rage of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that they acted on Chriſt not whatſoever their malicious mindes could have deſired, but what he had determined afore, to ſuffer that hee ſhould endure.

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Recite now ſome delivery concerning Chriſts ſufferings, as it is in the Church writings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In her larger Catechiſme it is ſaid, CHRIST ſuffered not onely a common death in ſight of men, but alſo was touched with the<note n="*" place="margin">For the more perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the word <hi>Hell,</hi> it may be noted, that ſometimes it ſignifieth a certaine darke and wofull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eſtate of the ſoule, in the body in this preſent life, out of which by Chriſt, Gods people doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like as by Chriſt they are preſerved from the hell of the damned: and the ſaid hell in this world is as it were a certain likenes in ſome manner and meaſure of the unexpreſtable dolefull hell in the world to come. The Church ſaith in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Nativity &amp; of the paſſion, that <hi>Adam</hi> in ſtead of the citizen of heaven was become the bondſlave of hell and a firebrand of hell. In the Homily for the reſurrection and pag. 192. it is ſaid, Chriſt paſſed through death and hel, to the intent to put us in good hope, that by his ſtrength we ſhall doe the ſame. In the larger Catechiſme on the tenth article it is ſaid, Faith lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the mind from hel it ſelfe unto life. Whereas in Rev. 1.18. it is ſaid, that Chriſt hath the keyes of hell and death, Is it not meant of his letting of peoples minds forth of the firſt death of ſinfulnes, and ſo out of the ſpirituall or firſt hell of ignorance, horrour, and unreſt fulnes in the conſcience? Conſider alſo the ſignification of the word hell in <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.18.</note> horrour of eternall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12300:32"/>death: he fought and wraſtled as it were hand to hand with the whole army of hell: before the Judgement ſeat of GOD hee put himſelfe under the heavy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and grievous ſeverity of Gods puniſhment: hee was driven into moſt hard diſtreſſe: hee for us ſuffered and went through horrible feares, and moſt bitter griefes of mind, to ſatisfie GODS juſt judgement in all things, and to appeaſe his wrath. For to ſinners, whoſe perſon CHRIST did here beare, not onely the ſorrowes and paines of preſent death are due, but alſo of death to come and everlaſting. So when he did take upon him and beare both the guiltineſſe and juſt Judgement of Mankind, which was undone and already condemned, hee was tormented with ſo great trouble and ſorrow of mind, that he cryed out, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> Hee ſuffered all theſe things without any ſinne, much leſſe did any deſperation poſſeſſe his ſoule. For hee never ceaſed in the meane time to truſt in his Father, and to have good hope of his ſafety. And being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet round about with feare, hee was never diſmayed or overwhelmed with ſorrow. And wreſtling with the whole power of hell, he ſubdued and<note n="n" place="margin">Rev. 3.21.</note> overcame all the force that ſtood againſt him, and all the furious and violent aſſaults.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> It is ſaid in her larger Catechiſme: That as Chriſt in his body deſcended into the bowels of the earth, ſo in his ſoule ſevered from his body hee deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into<note n="*" place="margin">The Church ſignifieth, that the hel wherein the departed damned ſoules are, is under the earth, in her largeſt catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me on the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Chriſts aſcenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12300:32"/>of the unbeleeving felt their moſt painfull and juſt damnation for<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 8.24.</note> infidelity, and Satan himſelfe the<note n="q" place="margin">1.

               <hi>A.</hi> The Church ſaith, both in her larger and ſhorter Catechiſme: <hi>Chriſts ſuffering &amp; death is not only a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of our miſeries, but alſo an</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">This point of Divinity the ſpirits of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience will not take notice of, though the Apoſtolicall Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to be neceſſarily learned, as now along fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it is manifeſted.</note> 
               <hi>example for us to follow: We ought after this example to bee obedient unto the will of God our heavenly Father, and patiently to take all injuries at mans hands, and to crucifie the wicked luſts of the fleſh, and to be as dead and buried unto ſinne. And if we bee once dead &amp; buried to ſinne, how ſhall wee hereafter live in the ſame?</hi> In the booke of common prayer, and of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies the doctrine of our imitating Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings is often mentioned, and urged as a matter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our learning and obſervation. Saint Paul ſaith:<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> If wee be children then are wee heires, heires of God, and joint heires with Chriſt; if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

If we ſuffer we ſhall alſo reigne with him. And therefore he ſaid concerning himſelfe:<note n="h" place="margin">Phil. 3.10.</note> That he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to know Chriſt, and the power of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable unto his death. Saint Peter ſaith:<note n="i" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.21.</note> Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example to follow his ſteps. And againe he ſaith:<note n="k" place="margin">1. Pet. 4.1.</note> Foraſmuch as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh, arme your ſelves likewiſe with the ſame mind: for he that hath ſuffered in the fleſh, hath ceaſed from ſin: that he no longer ſhould live the reſt of his time in the fleſh to the luſts of men, but to the will of God.</p>

For whereas the Jewes claimed and challenged to themſelves the Church of God as peculiar and by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall right due to their nation, and ſaid that it was theirs, and held it to be only theirs: the Chriſtian faith profeſſeth that a great number and infinite multitude of godly perſons, gathered together out of all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the world, out of all parts of all nations every where, and all ages of all times, by the ſtrength and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his holy word and voice, and by the divine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his heavenly Spirit, is by God incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Church as into his owne city, which all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Joh. 1.3.</note> communion that the godly have with God and among themſelves. For they are moſt neerely knit together in community of ſpirit, of faith, of ſacraments, of prayers, of forgiveneſſe of ſins, of eternall foelicity, and finally, of all the benefits that God giveth to his Church through CHRIST. Yea they are ſo joyned together with moſt ſtrait bonds of concord and love, they have ſo all one mind, that the<note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Cor. 12.26.</note> profit of any one and of them all is all one, and to this endeavour they doe moſt<note n="t" place="margin">Phil. 2.4.20.21.

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Church ſaith,<note n="r" place="margin">In her larger Catechiſme.</note> There is a moſt juſt reaſon.

The 1. mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ground of the tolerating of ſome recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening.</note> 
               <hi>meaner ſort who labour hard all the weeke ſhould have ſome recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to refreſh their ſpirits.</hi> Whereas in many places, eſpecially in Cities and Townes, ſervants are by their Maſters and Dames cauſed to labour privately (if not in ſome publike manner) on the moſt holy dayes in the yeere, even as on the working dayes; yea many are ſo hard towards their ſervants, as that on the very Sunday they wil employ them in painefull buſineſſes; whence it commeth to paſſe, that many for want of ſome bodily refreſhing in convenient time, have their ſpirits dull, and their underſtanding with melancholy and the like malady oppreſſed; yea often ſuch whoſe trade of life conſiſteth not in much firming of the body, doe contract within themſelfes ſuch diſeaſes, as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12300:58"/>doe ſhorten their naturall life. In townes and cities, and more eſpecially in the head city of the Kingdom, many ſervants labour hard all the ſixe dayes in an ill aire. When Sunday comes, they afore morning ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as alſo afore evening ſervice are all that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to bee in attendance, if not in ſome hard buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and if they may not<note n="*" place="margin">The Goſpell commandeth let all your, things be done with charity. 1.

How much is the life of ſuch ſervants, different from the life of ſlaves among the Turks? Their M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> &amp; Dames can in the week daies take their libertie and uſe their pleaſures. Now God ſaith, on the<note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 23.12. Deut. 5.12.</note> Sabbath thy ſervants and thy ſervants children are to reſt and to bee refreſhed as well as thy ſelfe. If any ſay, that the Jewes ſervants were onely to ceaſe from their ſervile labour, and to have no other refreſhing; and therefore ſervants are likewiſe now to have no other refreſhing, ſuch may conſider that the caſe of many of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants is not alike.

See <hi>Deuter.</hi> 16. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. &amp;c. And as the caſe of all ſuch ſervants is conſiderable, ſo alſo the condition of innumerable houſholders ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving children and charge, that for to get bread for themſelves and their family are conſtrained to worke early and late all the ſixe dayes: and ſhould ſuch have no bodily recreation all the yeere long? There is a proverbe, <hi>The full-fed knoweth not the ſufferings of an hungry ſtomacke.</hi> Thoſe that can recreate themſelves when they will, are commonly unſenſible what it is to be quite or much debarred from the ſame. Wee are
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12300:59"/>to thanke Almighty God, that our dread Soveraigne LORD the King can be touched with the feeling of meane mens endurings, and ſo graciouſly provide for their eaſe and comfort.

And even as Peter and John ſaid in another caſe, ſo may it bee ſaid: Whether is it better in the ſight of GOD, for people Sundayes after all Divine Services for that day ended, for to aſſemble together unto ſuch publike recreation as is allowed, than to keep at home or one to goe to anothers houſes, and there to ſpeake againſt the higher powers (eſpecially ſuch as are in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, there to talke of other folkes matters which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Moreover, whereas throughout the whole Kingdome there is a great neglect of very many in comming to evening prayer: For many of the richer ſort account it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming their State, to come to evening prayer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there be a Sermon; and many of the meaner ſort take example by them, concluding that if the richer may lawfully abſent themſelves from Church, why may not they likewiſe? Now by this preſcription of the Kings moſt excellent Majeſtie being in every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed point thereof duely obſerved, very many will repaire to the Divine Service more carefully, and ſo<note n="o" place="margin">Devotion will bee increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the due obſerving of the preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</note> devotion will be abundantly increaſed. And what is true godlineſſe? Can there be a more perfect god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, than for people to agree together in the truth of Gods holy word, and to live together in unity and godly love?

Concerning the feaſts of Dedication of Churches, thus it is ſignified in the Scripture. King Salomon having built the Lords Temple, did at the<note n="g" place="margin">1. Kings 8.65.66.</note> Dedication of it make a feaſt, and all Iſraell with him. It is written in the

See cap. 18.</note> Church, ſpeaking of what is written in the old Teſtament, <hi>If we be the people of God, how can the word and law of God not appertaine unto us?</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Every Scripture is given for our inſtruction in righteouſneſſe, that wee may be perfect unto<note n="m" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.17.</note> every good worke. And againe ſaith the Church (which though it be mentioned but about the fourth Commandement, yet it is to be made uſe of about<note n="n" place="margin">In the homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the time and place of prayer, pages 124.125.</note> every Commandement mentioned in the old Teſtament) <hi>Whatſoever is found in the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, appertaining to the law of nature, as a thing moſt godly, moſt iuſt, and needfull for the ſetting forth of Gods glory, it ought to be retained and kept of all good Chriſtian people.</hi> It is no indifferent matter to leave unobſerved ſuch feaſts, which are mentioned in the Scripture, and which the Church ſignifieth ſhould yeerely be kept. Moſt memorable hereunto is the ſaying of the Lord in Deuteronomy,<note n="o" place="margin">Deut. 28.45.46.47.</note> Curſes ſhall come upon thee for a ſigne, and for a wonder, and upon thy ſeed for ever: becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſſe, and with gladneſſe of heart, for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things. GOD ordained the feaſts to be kept, that in them all the people might expreſſe their thankfulneſſe unto him for his bleſſings given unto
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12300:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>them. And therefore the people of GOD in all ages have not only with great zeale and care kept the feaſts preſcribed unto them by GOD and the Church, but alſo in thankfulneſſe to God for ſundry bleſſings recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, have kept feaſts voluntarily, as <hi>Abraham</hi> made a feaſt when <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſon was<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 21.8.</note> weaned, ſo now at chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens chriſtening, womens churching, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="margin">In the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles delivered at the late Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropoliticall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <hi>That Church-houſes be kept in due repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and only for that right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe, for which they were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> In them the pariſhioners are to celebrate their banquet at Whitſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tide &amp;c. for the increaſe of godly love, &amp; for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of the poore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Thou ſhalt doe no murther.</p>
            <p>And here it is to be obſerved, as it was afore ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that GODS Commandements require our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them, aſwell inwardly as outwardly. Hence it is ſaid,<note n="m" place="margin">God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that wee ſhould honour the King with our very heart, and likewiſe to bear a reverent remembrance of all powers under Him, that are over us. Eccles. 10 20</note> Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought (or conſcience.) And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note n="n" place="margin">Col. 3.22.23.</note> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants obey in all things your maſters according to the fleſh: not with eye-ſervice, as men pleaſers, but in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſſe of heart fearing GOD: and whatſoever yee doe, doe it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men. So there is a committing of murther with the heart before the eyes of the Lord, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note n="o" place="margin">1. Joh. 3.15.</note> 
               <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeve hateth his brother is a murtherer.</hi> The Lord JESUS CHRIST (of whoſe comming one cauſe was (as the<note n="p" place="margin">In the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery page 84.

               <hi>That on theſe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements hang all the Law and the Prophets,</hi> we are given to underſtand, that there is no ſinne whatſoever, but it may be referred to be a breach of one of theſe ten precepts. So that if one ſhould take in hand for to ſhew all the duties required to be done by each Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and all the ſinnes forbidden by each, would it not require a very great volume for to containe ſuch a narration? The Church relleth us,<note n="ſ" place="margin">In her leſſer Catechiſme.</note> 
               <hi>That all things tending towards blood ſhedding, are alſo forbidden, as mocks, reproaches, quarrellings, fightings, and ſuch like.</hi> The ſinne of mocking and ſcoffing now greatly reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in very many, whereby they ſhew their murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous minds towards ſuch, at whom they ſcoffe. Many much delight themſelves in jeſting at others, though the Goſpel doth<note n="t" place="margin">Eph, 5.4.</note> expreſly forbid it, becauſe it is a thing not only uncomely, but alſo not proceeding from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for whom one loveth, he will not breake jeſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but<note n="u" place="margin">1.

The Prophet <hi>David</hi> prayed unto God for to deliver him from<note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 51.14.</note> bloud-guiltineſſe in the matter of <hi>Vriahs</hi> death. Even innumerable are the kinds of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering indirectly or by conſent, and to reckon up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them would be horrible to be read or heard. Such as live in retired manner as it were out of the world, or converſe with none but ſuch as either are civill, or doe carry themſelves civilly before them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine what evils are done by many in<note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 5.12.</note> ſecret, and where they dare ſhew themſelves in their proper colours. How many are indirectly murthered in ſuch and ſuch a manner, as the law of the land can take no hold on ſuch Murtherers? Univerſall cruelty is obſerved to be forbidden by this Commandement: And Gods word forbiddeth that any cruelty ſhould be ſhewed to any body chriſtian or unchriſtian, yea and to our<note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 12.10.</note> cattel or to any other<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 8.22.</note> creature Scarce any can comprehend how great avertue is charity, but ſuch as have experienced the mercies of uncharitable ones in theſe times. Many Spirituall murtherings might be here mentioned, inward and outward: as, The<note n="f" place="margin">1.

               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the ſeaventh Commandement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Thou ſhalt not commit adultery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Commandement is likewiſe broken, aſwel inwardly with the mind, as outwardly with the body; for CHRIST ſaith,<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 5.28.</note> 
               <hi>Whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her in his heart.</hi> And therefore the Lord ſignifieth in the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the ſaid ſentence, that he requireth wee ſhould mortifie our members which are upon earth: fornication, uncleaneneſſe, inordinate affection, evill concupiſcence,<note place="margin">Ioh. 31.1.</note> and not ſuffer<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 5.29.30.</note> eye or hand to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of any manner of unchaſtity, but to be only uſed, as GODS Law may not be by them in any wiſe tranſgreſſed. How many a law hath GOD given by <hi>Moſes</hi> for to ſhew (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) how every one ſhould poſſeſſe his<note n="o" place="margin">1.

For God hath not called us unto uncleaneneſſe, but unto holineſſe. And how are the apparant everlaſting lawes delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> hereunto by many utterly neglected? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, It is a ſhame even to<note n="p" place="margin">Eph. 5.12.</note> ſpeake of thoſe things which are done of them in ſecret. Why doth the Lord by <hi>Malachi</hi> ſay,<note n="q" place="margin">Mal. 4.4.</note> Remember yee the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which I commanded him in Horeb, for all Iſrael, with the ſtatutes and judgements? The Libertines of theſe daies will not conſider, that though <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12300:71"/>ſome lawes peculiar to the Jews, as concerning their ceremoniall, circumſtantiall, &amp; outward obſervation; yet that in all his bookes and in moſt chapters of his books there is expreſſed or ſignified that which is morall &amp;<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Polani Syntagma</hi> and therein lib. 10. cap. 23.

Is it now lawfull for a woman to be<note n="r" place="margin">See Lev 12.</note> Churched, afore ſuch time as it is by law of our Church preſcribed? Is it now lawfull for a man to marry his<note n="ſ" place="margin">Lev. 20.17.</note> ſiſter? And that is forbidden by Moſes in Leviticus.

               <note n="w" place="margin">In the 3. part and page 86.</note> 
               <hi>GOD at this preſent abhorreth all manner of uncleanneſſe, no leſſe than he did in the old law, and will undoubtedly puniſh it, both in this world, and in the world to come.</hi>

               <hi>This ſhall wee eaſily doe, if when wee feele inwardly, that Satan our old enemie tempteth us unto whoredome, we by no meanes conſent to his craftie ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, but valiantly reſiſt and withſtand him by ſtrong faith in the word of God, alleaging againſt him alwaies in our heart, this commandement of God: It is written, thou ſhalt not commit wheredome.

               <hi>A. Thou ſhalt not ſteale.</hi> This ſinne likewiſe may be committed in the heart, namely, when as one taketh from God that which is his. Hence the Prophet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy ſaith: Will a man<note n="b" place="margin">Mal. 3.9.</note> rob GOD? yet yee have robbed the Lord. Our heart is the Lords due; he ſaith:<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 23.26.</note>

               <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reines, even to give every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his wayes, and according to the fruit of his doings. As the partridge ſitteth on egges, and hatcheth them not: ſo he that getteth riches and not by</hi>

               <hi>O Lord the hope of Iſrael, all that for ſake thee ſhall be aſhamed, and they that depart from mee ſhall be written in the earth, becauſe they have forſaken the Lord the fountain of living waters.</hi> Univerſall unjuſt dealing between one another is forbidden by this precept. Workers of any<note n="g" place="margin">Pſ. 66.18. and therefore 119.3.</note> iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cannot aſſure themſelves, that they are in the way to Salvation. The Lord ſaith by Micah:<note n="h" place="margin">Micah 6.10.11.12.</note> Shall I count them pure with the wicked ballances, and with the bag of deceitfull weights? For the rich men thereof are full of violence: and the inhabitants thereof have ſpoken lies, and their tongue is deceitfull in their mouth. Saint Paul ſaith:<note n="i" place="margin">1.

But whoſo is a worker of injuſtneſſe ſhall periſh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly, how zealous ſoever he hath bin about other laudable matters, as CHRIST hath pronounced and<note n="l" place="margin">Luke 13.26.27.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12300:73"/>ſuch like, are by this law uncondemned.</hi> The LORD CHRIST JESUS hath given a rule ſerving to the obſervation of this commandement, and even of all the reſt toward man, the which if we remember and performe, we ſhall ſcarce at any time, in word or deed commit wrong againſt any one. And the rule is:<note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat. 7.12.</note> 
               <hi>Whatſoever ye would, that men ſhould doe unto you, the ſame doe ye unto them:</hi> and whatſoever yee would not that others ſhould doe unto you, doe not ye the ſame unto them. And this is to bee underſtood concerning thought, word, and deed.</p>

And that neither our ſelves at any time ſpeake any falſe or untrue thing, neither by words, writings, or ſilence, allow the ſame in other, but that wee ever love, follow, maintaine and uphold the truth.

The children of Satan will not be content themſelves to holde errours and hereſies, and live in diſobedience to God and Church; but alſo they will mortally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne all others, which will not profeſſe and practiſe, and walke<note n="a" place="margin">1.

Though the holy Ghoſt ſaith,<note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 21.8.</note> All liers ſhall have their part in the lake, that burneth with fire and brimſtone, the ſecond death; yet who layeth it to heart? To make conſcience of ſpeaking any untruth, is by God in Iſaiah delivered to be the peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his children, where it is ſaid: Surely they are my people,<note n="d" place="margin">Iſa. 63.9.</note> children that will not lie: ſo I was their Saviour. And to make no conſcience of uttering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths is by CHRIST delivered to be the peculiar propertie of the devils children, where it is ſaid: Yee are of your father the<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 8.44.</note> devill, and the luſt of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye will doe: for he is a lier, and the father there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

And alſo all they which doe not ſet their minds and ſtudies, to preſerve, maintaine, and defend, unto their neighbours (as much as it is in them) their wives, children, ſervants, houſes, lands, goods, and all that is theirs. For this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement not only forbiddeth us to deſire unlawfully from our neighbour any thing that is his: but by the ſame we be alſo commanded, gladly to wiſh and will unto him, that he may quietly poſſeſſe and enjoy all that which God hath ſent him, bee it never ſo great abundance. And this minde wee ought to beare unto every man by this commandement, not onely if they be our friends and lovers, but alſo if they be our enemies &amp; adverſaries. And it is there alſo ſaid: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore like as in the fift commandement, under the name of father and mother is underſtood all ſuperiours: and in the ſixt commandement, under the name of killing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all wrath and revenge: and in the ſeaventh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, under the name of adultery is underſtood all unchaſt living: and in the eight commandement, under the name of theft is underſtood all deceitfull dealing with our neighbours: and in the ninth commandement, under the name of falſe witneſſe, is underſtood all miſreport, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true uſe of our tongue: So in this laſt commandement, under the name of deſiring of another mans wife and goods, is underſtood all manner of evill and unlawfull deſire of any thing.</hi> Mortifie therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) evill

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is one of Gods promiſes unto his obedient people, as it is related in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, I (ſaith the Lord) will put my lawes into their minde, and<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 8.10.11.12.</note> write them in their hearrs.

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the firſt branch thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. To beleeve in God.</hi> And in the expoſition of the Creed the true beleefe (or what wee are to beleeve in and of God, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt) hath beene largely declared. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to God muſt beleeve that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeeke him.

            <p>
               <hi>A. To feare him:</hi> And that with a ſonnelike feare. It is ſaid of <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, when contending with the devill, he diſputed about the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that hee<note n="x" place="margin">Jude 9.</note> durſt not bring againſt the devill a railing accuſation, but ſaid, The Lord rebuke thee.

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the third?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To love him with all my heart, with all my minde, with all my ſoule, and with all my ſtrength.</p>
            <p>And how the CHURCH hath expounded theſe things, heare what is delivered in the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of charity, and the firſt part, viz. <hi>Charity is, to love God with all our heart, all our ſoule, and all our powers &amp; ſtrength. With all our heart, that is to ſay, that our heart, minde, and ſtudy be ſet to beleeve his word, to truſt in him, and to love him above all other things, that wee love beſt in heaven or in earth. With all our life, that is to ſay, that our chiefe joy and delight be ſet upon him and his honour, and our whole life given unto the ſervice of him above all things, with him to live and die, and to forſake all other things, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12300:76"/>than him. For he that loveth his father or mother, ſon or daughter, houſe or land, more than me</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> CHRIST) <hi>is not worthy to have me. With all our power, that is to ſay, that with our hands and feet, with our eyes and eares, our mouthes and tongues, and with all our parts and powers, both of body and ſoule, we ſhould be given to the keeping and fulfilling of his Commandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the fourth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. To worſhip him.</hi> And hee is to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with our whole man, both outward and inward, as it is ſaid by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 6.20.

Wherefore are theſe things written? Are they not for our<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Some obſerve that people are to make ſome obeiſance afore departing out of Church, as <hi>Former</hi> in his Theologie. See Exo. 12.27.28.</note> learning, as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul?</hi> Unto this very day even in all pariſhes there are ſome devoutly affected women, whoſe conſciences doe tell them that they ſhould make ſome obeyſance towards the gracious preſence of CHRIST in the Sanctuary, and before they kneele downe to prayer, they doe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:12300:77"/>conſtantly obſerve it. Likewiſe there are ſeene ſome ancient grave men in ſome places, which have retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch reverence, and are never unmindfull of the ſame, when they come<note n="g" place="margin">When the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine service is either already begun or upon beginning.</note> before JESUS CHRIST.

It is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt out of thoſe words of the Pſalm, that afore knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe to prayer, ſome obeiſance may be made towards Almighty GOD. <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note n="i" place="margin">Pſ. 119.126.

Almoſt all the lawes of GOD and Church concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reverence due to be done unto GOD in his holy temple, are by very many ſcarce any whit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. In the Epiſtle ſet afore the Church her leſſer Catechiſme in Latine, theſe words are: <hi>Fieri inquam non poteſt, quin &amp; Dei metum atque reverentiam, quae jam ex hoc mundo penè profligata eſſe videtur, &amp;c.</hi> Out of the which words and the reſt of the ſaid Epiſtle it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, That holy Church hath ſeriouſly conſidered on the great decay of the due fearing and reverencing of GOD, that is come to paſſe in this world; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carefully endeavoureth the repairing of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the fift?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. To give him thankes.</hi> And this duty is to bee done within the ſpirit, in bearing a gratefull minde continually unto GOD for all his mercies. So <hi>David</hi> did. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note n="k" place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.18.</note>

But to doe good, and to communicate, forget not: for with ſuch ſacrifices GOD is well pleaſed. And whereas by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to the poore the Lord is thanked, and one maine cauſe why the Lord hath commanded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to keepe feaſts, is, that the bowels of the poore may be refreſhed, that they may ſee ſome joyfull daies wherein to<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 16.11.14.15.</note> rejoyce with others before the Lord, Therefore bleſſed for ever be Our Kings moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Majeſty for thus reſtoring the feaſts of the Lord, which have been preſcribed by his Apoſtolike Church.

Wee ſhould make no other account, but that in hearing of man ſent from God, wee doe heare even God himſelfe: ſo that lookewith what awe, with what reverence, with what reſpect, with what ſubmiſsion we would demeane our ſelves, if we ſhould bee called to heare the</hi> LORD <hi>himſelfe perſonally ſpeake unto us from the clouds; with the ſame ought we to frame our ſelves to the hearing of them which are amongſt us in his ſtead, and whom he hath put into his ſervice: aſſure our ſelves, we ſhall never profit by hearing, untill this perſwaſion is ingrafted in us. This was it that brought Pauls miniſterie to be among the Theſſalonians, not in word onely, but in power. This made it to worke and prevaile ſo mightily as it did, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here alſo it is to be conſidered ſeriouſly, what the godly and Learned Doctour hath delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning peoples reverent and profitable hearing of Gods word. He ſaith:<note n="a" place="margin">M. Doctour <hi>Laurence</hi> in pages of his afore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sermon 4.5.6.8.</note> Standing is a poſture of reſpect, we kneele &amp; ſtand to our ſuperiours: kneele, to ſhew
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12300:83"/>our ſubjection; &amp; ſtand to ſhew our obedience; that we are ready to execute, what theſe are to command. Standing (ſaith hee) then is a poſture of reſpect, and reſpect is a preparation unto attention, for no man liſtens to what hee ſcornes. Standing is a poſture of attention, the poſture of hearers. When Eſra opened the law, all the people ſtood up. Neh. 8.5. There is no duty oftener enjoyned then this, &amp;c. It is required, that the Miniſter doe preach<note n="b" place="margin">In the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the late Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> ſtanding: and if it bee meet that the perſon teaching doe ſtand, is it not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe meet that the people hearing ſhould ſtand, every one as long as the ability of his body will ſerve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? And as it is there moſt<note n="c" place="margin">1.

Moreover the endeavouring to ſtand all the while Gods word is read or preached, as it is moſt profitable for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of edification, (becauſe God hath promiſed to give his<note n="d" place="margin">Iſa. 55.3.

Alſo it is a moſt holy law preſcribed by the Church, that every perſon ſhould uſe all due and lowly reverence, when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12300:83"/>the bleſſed Name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST is mentioned, unto the LORD JESUS CHRIST there. But how can this duty bee duely performed, when as wee ſit in the hearing of the word, wherein that ſacred Name is pronounced? Holy Church alſo<note n="f" place="margin">In the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and in Articles.</note> preſcribeth, that whiles God ſpeaketh unto us in his word read or preached, (like as while we are ſpeaking unto him in our praying, ſinging, and the like) yea in every part of his publike worſhip, we ſhould neither walke nor talke, nor uſe any kind of geſture or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour<note n="g" place="margin">Pſ. 2.11.

And whereſoever they are, which conſcionably give themſelves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme every reverence unto God, which is by the Church held forth unto them, either by precept, or example; continuall experience teacheth, that there through the power of GODS word and the Divine Service doctrine, the Lord giving increaſe, ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come<note n="h" place="margin">Eph. 4.23.</note> renewed in the ſpirit of their minde, and doe<note n="i" place="margin">2.

               <hi>A. To ſerve him truly all the daies of my life.</hi> And hereby wee are given to underſtand, that wee are to have God in remembrance, not only Sundaies; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all other daies and nights unto our lives end.

               <hi>A.</hi> It may be conceived to be there expreſſed in twentie.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Which is the firſt and ſecond?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. To love him as my ſelfe; And to doe unto all men as I would they ſhould doe unto me.</hi> And here is to be noted firſt, who is ones neighbour. The Church ſaith,<note n="b" place="margin">In the larger Catechiſme.</note> 
               <hi>The name of neighbour, conteyneth not only thoſe that dwell neere us, or be of our kin and alliance, or friends, or ſuch as be knit to us in a civill bond of love; but alſo thoſe whom wee know not, yea, and our enemies.</hi> Moreover ſaith the Church,<note n="c" place="margin">In the anſwer afore the other</note> CHRISTS <hi>will was that there ſhould bee moſt ſtrict bonds of love amongſt his Chriſtians. And as we be by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture moſt inclined to the love of our ſelves, ſo can there be not deviſed a plainer, nor ſhorter, nor more pithy, nor more indifferent rule of brotherly love; than that which the Lord hath gathered out of our own nature and ſet before us, that is, that every man ſhould beare to his neighbour the ſame good will that he beareth to himſelfe. Whereof it followeth, that we ſhould not doe any thing to our neighbour, nor ſay nor thinke any thing of him, which we would not have other to doe to our ſelves, or to ſay or thinke of our ſelves. Within the compaſſe of which only law, which is indeed as it were the ſoule of all other lawes, if we could be holden, ſurely there were no need of ſo many barres of lawes, as men doe daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to hold men in from doing wrong one to another, and to maintaine civill ſocietie; and all well-neare in vain, if among men this one law be not regarded.</hi>

How diſhonourably many children now both ſpeake and doe unto their Parents, it is a ſhame to mention.

The<note n="m" place="margin">In the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration afore mentioned.</note> Church in former time thus read that text, and according to the ſame ſenſe alſo: <hi>Hee that ſtealeth any thing from his father or mother, is to be taken as a murtherer.</hi>

Moreover, by Miniſters in this ſpeech there are ſuch to be underſtood, as are put in authority under His Highneſſe, for the adminiſtring of any buſineſſe in Church or Common-wealth.

And when God ſhall pleaſe to call one unto an higher eſtate of life, then likewiſe to meditate how to manage it alſo. The Church hereby giveth us to underſtand, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment commeth not by fortune, but by GODS calling of men into higher conditions of life.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Church doth give us to underſtand, that when wee have learned, what are our duties toward God and man, by our owne ſtrength we are not able to doe them duely. Saint Paul ſaith:<note n="r" place="margin">2. Cor. 3.5.</note> Not that wee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12300:90"/>are ſufficient of our ſelves to thinke any thing as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiencie is of God. CHRIST ſaith: Without me (or<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioh. 15.5. as in the margent.</note> ſevered from me) ye can doe nothing (or yee can bring forth no good fruit.) But ſaith Saint Paul:<note n="t" place="margin">Phil. 4.13. Pſ. 18.29.32.34.36.39.</note> I can doe all things through Chriſt ſtrengthening mee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is Gods ſpeciall grace, by the which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived we are able more and more obediently to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all our duties aforeſaid, and to walke in Gods commandements, and to ſerve him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is that which in the beginning of this Divine Service Catechiſme is called<note n="*" place="margin">This matter many doe not rightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider; but greatly erre from the truth herein.</note> 
               <hi>Gods helpe,</hi> where it is ſignified, that by Gods help I will beleeve &amp; doe the three things promiſed and vowed in my name, when I received holy Baptiſme. There cannot be found any one particular duty preſcribed by JESUS CHRIST, but by the holy Ghoſt ſtrengthening our inward and outward man, wee may bee<note n="u" place="margin">Marke 9.23.</note> able more and more obediently to obſerve the ſame. Moreover concerning grace, wee are to know, that it commeth unto us by meaſure, as Saint Paul ſaith: Unto every one of us is given grace, according to the<note n="w" place="margin">Eph. 4.7.</note> meaſure of the gift of CHRIST. There is a firſt meaſure of grace which is given unto univerſall mankind alike: as it is written: The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to<note n="x" place="margin">Tit. 2.11.</note> all men. CHRIST is that light, which enlighteneth<note n="y" place="margin">Ioh. 1.9.</note> every one that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into the world. And whoſoever doth make right uſe of that one talent of grace, and doth not<note n="z" place="margin">2. Cor. 6.1.</note> receive in vaine, nor<note n="a" place="margin">Iude 4.</note> turn it into wantonneſſe, nor letteth that<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 6.23.</note> light in him become to bee darkeneſſe, unto him that<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 25.29.30</note> hath and keepeth that conſcionably, CHRIST ſaith more ſhall be given, and at length he ſhall have abundance
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12300:91"/>of grace, yea ſuch an abundance (the ſpeciall grace is here ſignified) whereby he ſhall be able to walke more and more obediently in all Gods Commandements; as it is<note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 32.40.41. Ezech. 36.27.28.</note> promiſed in the holy Prophets. When Saint Paul had a ſtrong temptation unto pride, he beſought the LORD thrice, that it might depart from him. Unto whom the Lord ſaid:<note n="e" place="margin">2. Cor. 12.8.9.</note> My grace is ſufficient for thee: for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakeneſſe. Moſt gladly therefore (ſaid Paul) will I rather glory in mine infirmities, that the power of CHRIST may reſt upon me. CHRISTS Almighty ſtrength comming to aſſiſt Pauls weakeneſſe, enabled him to overcome that temptation, which in no wiſe by his owne ſtrength he could have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why is it ſaid, <hi>Wee muſt at all times call for Gods ſpeciall grace by diligent prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe it is from everlaſting ordeined, that man ſhall not receive that ſpeciall grace, without<note n="f" place="margin">Pſ. 14.4. Iames 4.2.</note> diligent prayer for it. God requireth that we muſt not be careleſſe and idle about our ſoules welfare, but duely<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 10.13.</note> call upon his name, and then we have his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to heare us and ſave us. CHRIST commandeth, ſaying:<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 7.7.8.9.</note> Aſke, and ye ſhall receive: ſeeke, and yee ſhall finde: knocke, and it ſhall bee opened unto you. For every one that aſketh, receiveth: and hee that ſeeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it ſhall bee opened. Your heavenly Father will give the holy Spirit to them that<note n="i" place="margin">Luke 11.13.</note> aſke him. And in the comming downe of that holy Spirit, there is received ſuch an abundance of grace, that ſpeciall grace by the Church ſignified. There are in the divine Service ſundry pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for that ſpeciall grace, as the third collect for grace, the prayer afore the ten Commandements, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Why is it ſaid by diligent prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Saint Paul ſaith:<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, when he had offered up prayers and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with ſtrong crying and tearers, unto him that was able to ſave him from death, &amp; was heard, in that he feared (or for his<note n="l" place="margin">As in the margent.</note> pietie.) If then it was neceſſary for Chriſt in his humane nature thus to pray unto his Father for what was requiſite, how much neceſſary is it for us to pray diligently? Wherefore the holy Ghoſt ſaith:<note n="m" place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.17.</note> Pray ye without ceaſing.

For it appeareth by Davids practiſe that GOD the infinite Spirit expecteth that ſo often at the leaſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day our hearts in ſpeciall manner to bee lifted up unto him.

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth the Church proceed from treating on the commandements, unto prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The reaſon appeareth out of the Catechiſme queſtion made afore the Lords prayer recited: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe that after wee have learned what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and doe, wee are to<note n="*" place="margin">Few doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themſelves unto due cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the name of the Lord, for that they conſider not how much it prevaileth with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made out of an obedient heart. 1. Ioh. 3.22.</note> pray for Gods helpe, his ſpeciall grace, his ſtrengthening of us for to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth the Church aſke her children, if they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12300:92"/>can ſay the Lords prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When any one is baptized, it is nominated, that ſo ſoone as hee is able to learne, he is to be taught the creed, the ten commandements, and the Lords prayer in the Engliſh tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why the Lords prayer, rather than any other prayer written in the Bible?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the infinite Wiſdome of Chriſt ſaw it meereſt to have his Diſciples taught<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 6.9.</note> thus to pray, and ſo his Church requireth every one of her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to<note n="r" place="margin">Luke 11.2.</note> ſay it. It is alſo the perfecteſt of all prayers in the Bible, and the moſt abſolute forme whereby to conceive other prayers acceptable unto God through JESUS CHRIST. In it is contained the<note n="ſ" place="margin">The ſumme of the promiſed bleſſings upon godlineſſe. 2. Tim. 4.8.</note> ſumme of all true Chriſtian hope, like as in the Creed is the ſumme of Faith, and in the Decalogue is the ſumme of Charitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it proper for every one of mankind to ſay the Lord prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is only proper for ſuch to ſay it, as can truely call God their father. Chriſt taught his obedient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thus to pray, who could call God,<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 8.15.16</note> Abba, Father. As for all people whoſe father is the<note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 8.44.</note> devill, &amp; whoſe workes they doe, which<note n="w" place="margin">Rev. 22.15.</note> love or make lies, which live in<note n="x" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.15.</note> envie, hatred, and malice; which abound with<note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 18.3.4. Mat. 10.15.</note> pride and arrogance, which regard not the due<note n="z" place="margin">2. Thef. 1.8 9</note> obedience unto CHRISTS Goſpell, and doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne or ſet light of the fundamentall doctrine of the<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note> Church delivered in her book of the Divine Service, untill ſuch turne unto unfeined<note n="b" place="margin">Ezech. 18.21.22.31.32.</note> repentance from all their ſins, they can not truely and properly be ſayers of the Lords prayer. It is a prayer peculiar for Chriſts body, the bleſſed company of all faithfull people; and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12300:92"/>therefore the firſt word of it is [our:] For they therein pray, not onely every one for himſelfe, but alſo one for another, as feeling members of the myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereof JESUS CHRIST is the head. Saint Paul ſaith:<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 12.25.26.27.</note> There ſhould be no Schiſme (or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) in the body: but the members ſhould have the ſame care one for another. And whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it: or one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it. Now are yee the body of Chriſt, and members in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth Chriſt teach us to ſpeake ſo directly unto God, ſaying <hi>our Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Becauſe</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>we ſpeake not to one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">In the leſſer Catechiſme.</note> 
               <hi>preſent.</hi> The not conſidering of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by his ſpirit every where, is a cauſe of many defects in our minds and converſations. David ſaith:<note n="e" place="margin">Pſ. 139.7.</note> Whither ſhall I goe from thy ſpirit? or whither ſhall I flie from thy preſence?<note n="f" place="margin">verſes 3.5.13.12.</note> Thou compaſſeſt my path, and my lving downe; Thou haſt beſet me behind and before. Thou haſt poſſeſſed my reines: thou haſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me in my mothers wombe. The darkeneſſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not from thee, but the night ſhineth as the day: the darkeneſſe and the light are both alike unto thee. Moreover it is the cuſtome of children, when they ſpeake unto their parents, firſt to call them by the name of father or mother, as having that priviledge. So the prodigall ſonne repenting, beginneth ſaying:<note n="g" place="margin">Luke 15.18.</note> Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven and againſt thee. Saint Paul calleth our parents on earth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our fleſh, but God hee calleth the<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 12.9.</note> father of our ſpirits. For howſoever nature hath its conſtituted courſe in the generation of mankind, yet ſcripture
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:12300:93"/>declareth that the Spirit of GOD ruleth in nature, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it to have its courſe, or<note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 16.2. and 20.18. and 30.2.</note> hindering the ſame, cauſing alſo<note n="k" place="margin">1. Sam. 1.5.5.11.17.19.20.</note> fruitfulneſſe and barrenneſſe, according to his holy and righteous will. S. Paul ſaith:<note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 4.6.</note> There is one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all, unto whom wee (behaving our ſelves as dutifull children, in having<note n="m" place="margin">Pſ. 119.6. 1. Joh. 4.22.</note> reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his commandements) may<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 4.15.16.</note> boldly ſpeake in the name and mediation of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, that we may obtaine mercie, and find grace to helpe in time of need. In the Homily for good Friday it is ſaid:<note n="o" place="margin">In page 176.177.</note> In Baptiſme wee promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the devill and his ſuggeſtions, wee promiſed to be (as obedient children) alwaies following Gods will and pleaſure. Then if he bee our Father indeed, let us give him his due honour. If we be his children, let us ſhew him our obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And (ſaith the Church) if we want any thing, for body or ſoule, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and boldly approach to God, as to our mercifull father, to aſke that wee deſire, and we ſhall obtaine it. So well pleaſed is the Father Almighty God with Chriſt his Sonne, that for this ſake he favoureth us, and will denie us nothing. So pleaſant was this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and oblation of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cor. 2.16. &amp; 2. Cor. 4.10.11.</note> true Chriſtians indeed, and not in word only) we be now fully in GODS grace againe, and clearely diſcharged from our ſinne. And afterward the Church addeth:<note n="p" place="margin">In page 178.</note> 
               <hi>That Chriſts paſsion is not only the ranſome and whole amends for our ſinne, but it

For ſurely (as ſaith Saint</hi> Peter) CHRIST <hi>therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to leave us an example to follow his ſteps: And if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall be ſure alſo to reigne with him in heaven, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the firſt petition in the Lords prayer?</p>

               <hi>A.

            <p>
               <hi>A. Thy Kingdome come.</hi> And thus hath the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Church of England written on the ſame.<note n="a" place="margin">In the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof. It is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that by the ſaid name is meant the book afore mentioned, ſet forth by the Church in the later part of the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight.</note> This
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:12300:94"/>ſecond Petition is very neceſſary, for no doubt our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enemy the devill goeth about continually by all crafty meanes, to deceive us, and bring us under his power and dominion. And ſurely ſo long as pride and diſobedience reigneth in us, ſo long as ire, envy, wrath, or covetouſneſſe reigneth in us, ſo long as gluttony, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, or any kind of ſinne reigneth in us, ſo long we be under the dominion and kingdome of the devill. For the devill undoubtedly, is the<note n="b" place="margin">Job. 41.34.</note> king over all the children of pride, that is to ſay, over all them that be ſinners, rebels, and diſobedient unto GOD. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is not in our owne power to deliver our ſelves from under this tyranny of the devill, but only by Gods helpe (for our<note n="c" place="margin">Hoſ. 13.9.</note> perdition and undoing is of our ſelves, but our helpe and ſalvation is of GOD, as ſaith the Prophet <hi>O ſee</hi>) therefore it is very neceſſary for all true Chriſtian people, to make this petition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly unto our heavenly father, and to beſeech him according to this doctrine of CHRIST, that by his grace and helpe, we may eſcape the dominion and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the devill, &amp; that we may be made ſubject unto his heavenly kingdome. Therefore in this petition we deſire GOD to give us before all things, true and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant faith in him, and in his Sonne JESUS CHRIST, and in the holy Ghoſt, with pure love and charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him and all men, to keepe us from all infidelity, deſperation and malice, which might be the cauſe of our deſtruction, to deliver us from diſſentions, covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, lecherie and evill deſires, and luſts of ſin, and ſo the vertue of his Kingdome to come, and to<note n="d" place="margin">Luke 17.21. Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace is a matter within the ſoul of man, upon which manner of Chriſts reigning few duly conſider.</note> reigne within us, that all our heart, mind, and wits, with all our ſtrength inward and outward, may be ordered and directed to ſerve God, to obſerve his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12300:95"/>and his will, and not to ſerve our ſelfe, the fleſh, the world, or the devill. We deſire alſo, that this kingdome once in us begun, may be daily increaſed and goe forward more and more, ſo that all ſubtile and ſecret hate, or ſloth, which wee have to goodneſſe, be not ſuffered to rule ſo in us, that it ſhall cauſe us to look back againe, and to fall into ſinne; but that we may have a ſtable purpoſe and ſtrength, not only to begin the life of innocency, but alſo to proceed earneſtly further in it, and to perform it, according to the ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> where he prayeth, that wee may<note n="e" place="margin">Col. 1.9.10.11.</note> walke worthily, pleaſing God in all things, being fruitfull in all good workes, and growing and increaſing in the knowledge of God. Alſo in another place hee ſaith,<note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 4.15.</note> Worke and doe the truth in charity, and encreaſe and goe forward in CHRIST. Therefore in this prayer, deſiring the kingdome of God to come, wee require alſo, that wee being already received and entred into the kingdome of<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 5.21.</note> grace and mercy of God, may ſo continue and perſevere therein; that after this life, we may come to the kingdome of glory, which endureth for ever. The Church alſo ſaith,<note n="h" place="margin">In her larger Catechiſme.</note> We pray that Gods kingdome come, that is, that he ſuffer not the divine truth of his word, which alſo CHRIST calleth the Goſpell of the Kingdome, to lie hidden in darkneſſe, but that he daily more and more bring it abroad, and with his ſuccour maintaine and defend it againſt the deviſes, craft, and policie of Satan, and of wicked men, and againſt their<note n="*" place="margin">Or the laid ambuſhment, or framed wiles.</note> fained treaſons that labour to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the truth, and to defame or ſpot it with lyes, and againſt the violence and cruelty of tyrants, that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile by all meanes to extinguiſh and oppreſſe the truth and utterly to root it up: ſo as it may be made
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:12300:95"/>manifeſt and well knowne to all men, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing able to reſiſt the invincible ſtrength of GODS truth.

            <p>
               <hi>A. Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> The Church ſaith:<note n="ſ" place="margin">In the larger Catechiſme.</note> By the name of bread is meant, not onely thoſe things that miniſter us food and apparell, but alſo all other things univerſally, that are needfull to the maintaining and preſerving of our life, and the leading of it in quietneſſe without feare. It is called <hi>our</hi> bread, becauſe it becommeth ours, when he liberally<note n="t" place="margin">Pſ. 115.16.</note> giveth it us for our daily uſes, though by right it bee not due to us. David ſaith:<note n="u" place="margin">Pſ. 24.1.</note> 
               <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof.</hi> By this word <hi>bread,</hi> we are put in minde, that wee ought to get our living with our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or by other lawfull meanes, &amp; that being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with contented, wee doe never, by covetouſneſſe or fraud, ſeeke any thing of other mens.<note n="w" place="margin">In the leſſer Catechiſme.</note> Wee aſke bread of God, becauſe that in vaine ſhall we waſt all the courſe of our life in toile of body and travell of mind, unleſſe it pleaſe GOD to<note n="x" place="margin">Pſ. 127.1.2. and 1.

There are added theſe words <hi>daily</hi> and <hi>this day,</hi> That we avoiding all carefull covetouſnes, &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligently our duty, ſhould daily crave of our moſt liberall father that, which he is ready daily to give us. The words of<note n="z" place="margin">Prov. 30.8.</note> 
               <hi>Agur</hi> are: give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with foode convenient for me. The<note n="a" place="margin">In her decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> Church alſo hath delivered, that by <hi>bread</hi> we are alſo to underſtand the holy Sacrament of the body and bloud of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaith:<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 6.51.</note> I am the bread of life, which came downe from heaven. And the bread which I will give, is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world. And in this prayer, wee deſire, that the ſame may bee purely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred and diſtributed, to the comfort and benefit of us all, the true children of God. And that wee may alſo receive the ſame with a right faith, and perfect charitie, at all times, when we doe and ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame, ſo that we may be ſpiritually fed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to our ſalvation, and thereby enjoy the life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. By bread alſo is meant the<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 9.5. Iſa. 55.2.</note> true doctrine of the word of God, which is the ſpirituall bread which feedeth the ſoule. For as the body is nouriſhed and brought up, groweth and feedeth with bread and meate; ſo needeth the ſoule even from our youth to be nouriſhed and brought up with the word of God, and to be fed with it. And like as the body will faint and decay, if it be not from time to time releived and refreſhed with bodily ſuſtenance: even ſo the ſoule waxeth feeble and weake towards God, unleſſe the ſame be cheriſhed and kept up with the word of God, according to the ſaying of Chriſt: A man liveth not with meate only, but with every word that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the mouth of God. And ſurely the word of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:12300:97"/>God is the very comfort, remedy, and health of the ſoule. If we have any maner of ſicknes or diſeaſe in our ſoules, what medicine or remedie can wee have, but that is declared in GODS word?</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the fift petition?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. And forgive us our treſpaſſes, as wee forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us.</hi> The Church ſaith in the former Homily for good Friday:<note n="e" place="margin">In the former Homily and page 179.</note> It is not meet that we ſhould crave forgiveneſſe of our great offences at Gods hands, and yet will not forgive the ſmall treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes of our neighbours againſt us. Wee doe call for mercie in vaine, if wee will not ſhew mercie to our neighbours. For if we will not put wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure forth of our hearts to our Chriſtian brother, no more will God forgive the diſpleaſure and wrath that our ſins have deſerved afore him. For under this<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 6.14.15. and 18.35.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth he forgive us, if we forgive other. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth not Chriſtian men to bee hard one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor yet to thinke their neighbour unworthy to be forgiven. For howſoever unworthy hee is, yet is Chriſt worthy to have thee doe thus much for his ſake, he hath deſerved it of thee, that thou ſhouldeſt forgive thy neighbour. And God is alſo to be obeied, which commandeth us to forgive, if we will have any part of the<note n="*" place="margin">Here is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith or divinity. Chriſt by his death obtained par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the ſins of the whole world: but yet no perſon in particular can receive his part in the ſaid generall (or rather univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall pardon) but upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. See Acts 26.18.</note> pardon which our Saviour Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed once of God the Father, by ſhedding of his precious blood. The Homily againſt contention ſaith:<note n="g" place="margin">In pag. 93.94.</note> Mine enemy (ſay ſome) is not worthy to have gentle words or deeds, being ſo full of malice or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe. Thy neighbour hath peradventure with a word offended thee: call thou to thy remembrance with how many words &amp; deeds, how grievouſly thou haſt offended thy Lord God. What was man, when
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12300:98"/>Chriſt died for him? Was he not his enemy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to have his favour and mercie. Even ſo, with what gentleneſſe and patience doth he forbeare, and tolerate, and ſuffer thee although he is daily offended by thee? What crakeſt thou of thy head, if thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not to bee in the body? Thou canſt be no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of CHRIST, if thou follow not the ſteps of CHRIST. The Church alſo hath delivered:<note n="h" place="margin">In her decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> Yee ſhall underſtand, that foregiveneſſe afore ſpoken of, is not ſo meant in Scripture, that by it juſtice or laws of Princes ſhould bee broken, contemned, or not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. For although our Saviour CHRIST in this petition doth teach us to remit and forgive all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and treſpaſſes done againſt us; yet he which hath done the injury or treſpaſſe, is, nevertheleſſe bound to<note n="i" place="margin">Luke 17.3.4.</note> acknowledge his fault, and to aſke forgiveneſſe therefore, not only of God, but of him alſo whom he hath offended, and to intend to doe no more ſo. And furthermore to recompence and make amends unto the parties, againſt whom he hath treſpaſſed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his abilitie and power, and as the greevouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and greatneſſe of the offence requireth. And in caſe hee which hath committed the offence or treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, be<note n="k" place="margin">1. Tim. 1.9.10. Exodus 21.19.22. and 22.9.10.11.12. &amp;c. Deut. 17.8. &amp;c.</note> obſtinate, and will not doe theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearſed, which he is bound to doe by the law of God, then may the party, which findeth himſelfe grieved, notwithſtanding any thing that is ſaid afore in this petition, lawfully and without offence of Gods commandements aſke and ſeeke recompence of ſuch injuries, as bee done to him, according to the order and proviſion of the laws of the Realme, made in that behalfe; ſo that he alway have an eye and reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to charitie, and doe nothing for rancour, or malice,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12300:98"/>or for ſiniſter affection, neither beare any hatred in his heart toward him, whom he ſueth, but only upon a zeale and love of the maintenance of juſtice, correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vice, and reformation of the partie that hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; remembring alwayes that he exceed not, nor goe beyond the limits and bounds of this generall rule, taught by our Saviour Chriſt in his Goſpell: <hi>As yee would that men ſhould doe unto you, even ſo doe you unto them: for this is the law and the Prophets.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evill.</hi> And ſaith the Church:<note n="l" place="margin">In her ſhorter Catechiſme.</note> As we before doe aſke forgiveneſſe of ſinnes paſt, ſo now wee pray that we ſin no more. For wee by nature are ſo unwarie to foreſee, and ſo weake to reſiſt the manifold ſnares, temptations, and inticements of the devill, the world, and the concupiſcence of the fleſh, that wee cannot but be overcome, unleſſe GOD doe aſſiſt us with his grace, and arme us with his ſtrength: and therefore we fly by prayer unto the protection of our Almighty and moſt loving Father, that hee will not ſuffer us to be overcome with any wicked temptation, but that hee will deliver and ſave us from evill.<note n="m" place="margin">In the larger Catechiſme.</note> Wee pray that God lead us not into temptation, becauſe God as he defendeth and<note n="n" place="margin">2. Cor. 12.9. 2.

The<note n="q" place="margin">In her decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> Church hath alſo delivered, That there be two manner of temptations, whereof one commeth and is ſent to us by God, who ſuffereth thoſe that bee his, to bee tempted by one meanes or other, for their probation or triall, albeit he ſo aſſiſteth and ardeth them, in all ſuch temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that hee turneth all at the end unto their profit and benefit. For as the wiſe man ſaith:<note n="r" place="margin">Ecclus. 27.5. The Church there readeth according to the vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</note> 
               <hi>Like as the oven trieth the potters veſſell, ſo doth temptation of trouble trie the righteous man.</hi> And with this manner of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation God ſundry wiſe tempted our holy father Abraham, he tempted alſo Job with extreme poverty, horrible ſickneſſe, and ſodaine death of his children: and daily hee tempteth and prooveth all ſuch as he loveth. It is ſaid concerning Ezekiah in the booke of Chronicles:<note n="ſ" place="margin">2. Chron. 32.31.</note> How beit, in the buſineſſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of the Princes of Babylon, who ſent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart. The other manner of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commeth chiefly of the<note n="t" place="margin">1. Cor. 7.5.</note> devill, which like a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and a wood lion, rageth and runneth about per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually ſeeking how he may devoure us. The Church alſo there ſignifieth of our temptation by our owne concupiſcence, whereof Saint James ſaith:<note n="u" place="margin">James 1.14.</note> Every man is tempted, when he is drawne away of his owne luſt, and is enticed: and that by the devill and this our concupiſcence &amp; our conſent, all vice and ſins be engendred, like as between man and woman children be ingendred, according to the ſaying of Saint James,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12300:99"/>where he ſaith,<note n="w" place="margin">James 1.15.</note> Concupiſcence when ſhe doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſhe bringeth forth ſinne, and that of all ſorts, that is to ſay, firſt acts and deeds, contrary to the lawes of God; and after that, uſe and cuſtome of the ſame deeds; and at length blindneſſe and contempt. Wherefore (ſaith the Church) conſidering how dangerous it is to fall into ſinne, and how hard it is to ariſe, the chiefe and beſt way is, to<note n="x" place="margin">James 4.7. Eph. 6.11.12.13.14.15.16.17</note> reſiſt with Gods helpe the firſt ſuggeſtion unto ſinne, and not to ſuffer it to<note n="y" place="margin">Eph. 4.27.</note> prevaile w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> us; but as ſoon as may be, to put it out of our minds. For if we ſuffer it to tarry any while in our hearts, it is great peril, leſt that conſent &amp; deed will follow ſhortly after. The Church there alſo hath delivered, That our Saviour JESUS CHRIST teacheth us not in this ſixt petition to pray unto God our Father, that we ſhould be cleerely without all temptation: but that hee will not ſuffer us to be led into temptation, that is to ſay, that when wee be tempted, hee will give us grace to withſtand it, and not to ſuffer us to be overcome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, according whereunto Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note n="z" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.13.</note> GOD is true and faithfull, and will not ſuffer us to be tempted above that we may beare, but he will ſo moderate the temptation, that wee may ſuſtaine and overcome it. And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith,<note n="a" place="margin">James 1.2.3.</note> Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations, knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience: but let patience have her perfect worke, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>

There is mention made of the glory of God, for to teach us to conclude all our prayers with praiſes of God: for that is the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all that wee deſire to obtaine in our prayer, and all our thoughts, words, and works, and all things uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ought to be referred and applyed.

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are ſaid to be moſt conveniently treated of after diſcourſe of prayer and thankeſgiving,<note n="l" place="margin">In the leſſer Catechiſme.</note> for that they have alwaies prayers and thankeſgiving joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto them.

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why at all would God have us to uſe ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Church faith,<note n="m" place="margin">In her larger Catechiſme.</note> Surely we are not endued with minde and underſtanding ſo heavenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that the graces of God doe appeare clearely of themſelves to us as it were to Angels, by this meane therefore God hath provided for our weakneſſe, that we which are earthly and blind, ſhould in outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and figures, as it were in certaine glaſſes, behold the heavenly graces, which otherwiſe wee were not able to ſee. And greatly for our behoofe it is, that Gods promiſes ſhould be alſo preſented to our ſenſes, that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:12300:103"/>they may be confirmed to our mindes without doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note n="n" place="margin">In an anſwer a little after.</note> Moreover to lighten and give bright cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to mens minds and ſoules, and to make their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences quiet and in ſecurity, as they be in deed, ſo ought they to be accounted the proper workes of the holy Ghoſt alone, and to be<note n="o" place="margin">Luke 12.12. Joh. 1.33. and 6.63. and 14.17.26. and 1. Cor. 4.6. &amp;c.</note> imputed to him, and this praiſe not to be transferred to any other. But this is no impediment but that God may give to his myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the ſecond place in quieting and ſtabliſhing our minds and conſciences, but yet ſo that nothing be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the vertue of his ſpirit. Wherefore we muſt determine, that the outward element hath neither of it ſelfe, nor in it ſelfe incloſed the force and efficacy of the Sacrament, but that the ſame wholy floweth from the<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 1.33. Acts. 1.5. and 10.45.</note> ſpirit of God, as of a ſpring-head, and is by the divine myſteries, which are ordained by the Lord for for this end, conveyed unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why is it ſaid, that CHRIST hath ordained in his Church <hi>Two Sacraments onely, as generally neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Church ſaith,<note n="q" place="margin">In her larger Catechiſme.</note> Baptiſme and the Lords Supper are the two Sacraments commonly uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the faithfull. By the one we are born againe, and by the other we are nouriſhed to everlaſting life. So that theſe two are neceſſary for the<note n="r" place="margin">In the homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of common prayer and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments the Church ſaith, That theſe two are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of every chriſtian in due time and order. In page 135.</note> generality of the Church: for every one is required to be baptized, that would be a member of Chriſts viſible Church: and every one is required to partake of the Lords Supper, ſo ſoone as he commeth to age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are there any other Sacraments, which Chriſt hath ordained in his Church beſides theſe two?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In the Homily concerning ſwearing, the Church calleth<note n="ſ" place="margin">In the firſt part, page 47. of Tome 1.</note> Matrimony a Sacrament. And in the Homily
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:12300:103"/>concerning prayer and Sacraments it ſaith: That in a generall acception, the name of Sacrament may bee attributed to any thing whereby an holy thing is ſignified. And the Church there ſignifieth, that<note n="*" place="margin">See the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and pages 135. 136. Tome 2.</note> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, Ordering of Miniſters, Confirmation of children, and Extreame Unction, have bin called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments by ancient Writers: but yet no man ought to take theſe for Sacraments, in ſuch ſignification and meaning, as the Sacraments of Baptiſme, and the Lord ſupper are. Moreover, that confirmation is not of ſuch neceſſity as Baptiſme is, The Church ſheweth where it ſaith: And that no man ſhall thinke that any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment ſhall come to children by deferring of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation, he ſhall know the truth; that it is certaine by Gods word, <hi>That children being baptized, have all things</hi>

               <hi>neceſſary for their ſalvation, and bee undoubtedly ſaved.</hi> But yet Confirmation is neceſſary to be had, as ſoone as it may with convenience, by reaſon of the great bleſſing received therein from God by ſuch as with due preparation have it miniſtred unto them. And therefore ſaith the Church:<note n="u" place="margin">In the end of the rubricke of Confirmation.</note> 
               <hi>None ſhould bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the holy Communion, untill ſuch time as hee can ſay the Catechiſme and be confirmed.</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">In her larger Catechiſme.</note> It is an outward teſtifying of Gods good will and bountifulneſſe towards us through CHRIST, by a viſible ſigne repreſenting an inviſible and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace, by which the promiſes of God touching<note n="x" place="margin">Acts 2.38.

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Relate what is ſaid in the larger Catechiſme, why infants are to be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Seeing God, which never ſwarveth from truth, nor in any thing ſtrayeth from the right way, did not exclude infants in the Jewiſh Church from Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, neither ought our<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 3.29.</note> infants to be put backe from baptiſme. As Moſes and all the Prophets doe teſtifie that<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 30.6. Jer. 4.4.</note> Circumciſion was a ſigne of repentance, ſo doth Saint Paul teach that it was a<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> Sacrament of Faith. Yet the Jews children being not yet by age capable of faith and repentance were nevertheleſſe circumciſed, by which viſible ſigne God ſhewed himſelfe in the old Teſtament to be the father of young children, and of the ſeed of his people. Now ſith it is certaine that the grace of GOD is more plentifully powred, and more cleerly declared in the Goſpell by CHRIST, that at that time it was in the old teſtament by Moſes, it were a great indignity if the ſame grace ſhould now be thought, to be either obſcurer or in any part abated. Sith it is certaine that our infants have the force, and as it were the<note n="k" place="margin">Matt. 18 3.4.10. and 19.14. Luk. 18.15.16.17. Rom. 4.16. Act. 2.39.</note> ſubſtance of baptiſme common with as, they ſhould have wrong done them, if the ſigne,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:12300:106"/>which is inferiour to the truth it ſelfe, ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them; and the ſame, which greatly availeth to teſtifying of the mercie of God and confirming of his promiſes, being taken away, Chriſtians ſhould bee defrauded of a ſingular comfort, which they that were in old time, enjoyed; and ſo ſhould our infants bee more hardly dealt with in the new Teſtament under CHRIST, than it was dealt with the Jewes infants in the old Teſtament under Moſes. Therefore moſt great reaſon it is, that by Baptiſme as by the print of a ſeale, it be aſſured to our infants that they be heires of Gods grace, and of the ſalvation promiſed to the ſeed of the faithfull. Sith alſo the Lord Chriſt calleth infants unto him, &amp; commandeth that no man forbid them to come, embraceth them when they come to to him, and teſtifieth that to them the Kingdome of Heaven<note n="l" place="margin">Mar. 10.13.14.15.</note> belongeth: whom God vouchſafeth to bee in the heavenly palace, it ſeemeth a great wrong that men ſhould forbid them the firſt entrie and doore thereof, and after a certain manner to ſhut them out of the Chriſtian common wealth.</p>

            <p>And for our better underſtanding of what is the Church-her meaning concerning this her laſt clauſe in her Catechiſme, <hi>of being in charity with all men,</hi> let us ſeriouſly conſider and ever remember the expreſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery hereabout in the end of the firſt part of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of charity, where the words of the Church are as here followeth. Thus have I ſet forth unto you what charity is, as well by the doctrine as by the example of CHRIST himſelfe, whereby alſo every man may without errour know himſelfe, what ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſtandeth in, whether he be in charity, (and ſo the child of the Father in heaven) or not For although almoſt every man perſwadeth himſelfe to be in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet let him examine none other man, but his owne heart, his life and converſation, and he ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but truely diſcerne or judge whether he be in perfect charity or not. For hee that followeth not his owne appetite and will, but giveth himſelfe earneſtly unto God, to doe all his will and Commandements,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12300:113"/>he may be ſure that he loveth God above all things, and els ſurely he loveth him not, whatſoever hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: as CHRIST ſaid, <hi>If ye love me, keepe my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. For he that knoweth my commandements and keepeth them, he it is</hi> (ſaith CHRIST) <hi>that loveth mee.</hi> And againe he ſaith, <hi>He that loveth me, will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will both come unto him, and dwell with him: And he that loveth me not, will not keepe my words.</hi> And likewiſe he that beareth a good heart and mind, and uſeth well his tongue and deeds unto every man, friend and foe, he may know thereby that he hath charity. And then he is ſure that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God taketh him for his deare beloved ſon, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hereby manifeſtly are knowne the children of God, from the children of the Devill: for whoſoever doth not love his brother, belongeth not unto God.</hi>

The Church alſo hath ſignified, that if the holy ordinance of Confirmation be<note n="w" place="margin">This is much to be noted, that (as the Church ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving of the Sacraments and holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of them is enjoyed.</note> worthily taken, thereby is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more abundantly ghoſtly ſtrength, aid and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And therefore is very wholſome and profitable, and to be deſired, and reverently received. Now the cauſe why ſome receive the ſaid ſacred Ordinance and are not the better, is, becauſe they receive it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, like as many unworthily receive the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and are nothing benefited thereby. Whoſo would enjoy the ſaid bleſſings, are to learne afore they ſeeke for it, the meaning of the Catechiſme, the ground and neceſſity of Confirmation, as it is ſhewed in the<note place="margin">Immediately afore the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme therein. See chap. 54.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer booke; they are to conſider what the<note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. 84.</note> ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven graces of the holy Ghoſt are, which are the more abundantly received by due taking of this ordinance, and to be reſolved for to enter and continue in the Chriſtian warfare fighting in it manfully and zealouſly under CHRISTS banner againſt ſinne, the world, and the devill: and ſo to hunger and thirſt after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Confirmation, which whoſo unfeinedly doe before GODS all-ſeeing eyes, he then in the act of the Biſhopping, and afterward more and more accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his wiſedome and goodneſſe, giveth all that is prayed for in the Service thereof.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Cannot a Prieſt or Paſtour reading the Service of Confirmation, and laying his hand upon the head of every child, performe the Confirmation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In no wiſe: for it is<note n="x" place="margin">Prieſts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miniſter Confirmation.</note> only proper to the order of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:12300:115"/>Biſhops, and is therefore called <hi>a Biſhopping.</hi> It is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Acts of the Apoſtles, that though Philip did convert unto the faith people of Samaria, and did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, yet it was by the Apoſtles<note n="y" place="margin">Act. 8.14.17.</note> laying on of their hands, that they received the holy Ghoſt. The giving of the holy Ghoſt is by GOD diſpoſed unto the Apoſtolicall or Epiſcopall order. The keyes of the Kingdome of heaven are committed by GOD into the hands of the Clergie: and as to Abſolve is the worke of the Prieſthood, ſo to confirme is the worke of the High-prieſthood. A lay perſon hath not ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power to performe the Abſolving of a penitent ſinner, but he that is in the<note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 16.19. Joh. 20.22.23.</note> prieſthood: ſo to <hi>Confirme,</hi> to cauſe ſuch a meaſure of the holy Ghoſt to deſcend upon a baptized partie, a Prieſt hath not enough ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power, but a<note n="a" place="margin">Acts 19.6.</note> Biſhop<note n="*" place="margin">As every one in temporall power can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what the Kings Majeſty with the law of the kingdome enableth him unto, ſo every one in ſpiritual order can effect that as God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and which ability his word hath ſignified to be annexed and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto ſuch an order in the holy miniſtery.</note> only. A Prieſt cannot make a Prieſt or Deacon, but a Biſhop can, according as it is preſcribed in the booke of the Ordering of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. The reaſon is, The Almighty GOD in all his workes hath ſet and keepeth a conſtant courſe, as well here on earth, as in heaven. The Moone hath not that power, which the Sunne hath; neither is there the like influence from all the ſtarres; but from ſome is more, from ſome is leſſe. God worketh with what is done according to his Ordinance, but not otherwiſe. It is ſo in civill adminiſtrations: for if any put the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Seale unto a writing, who have not from His Highneſſe authority thereunto, is it of any validity or force, when it commeth to be conſidered?</p>

               <hi>It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us, &amp;c.</hi> And whereas among all in the Clergie they are the neereſt unto GOD, and doe comprehend the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall matters pertaining unto Chriſtian religion, in ſo much as if a Biſhop chance to be in doubt about the meaning of the Church concerning the uſe of a matter in the Liturgie, he is (as it is written in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on booke) to ſend for reſolution thereof unto the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop: it is therefore the duty of all in the Clergie for

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:12300:117"/>of the ſpirit. And even as beaſts can ſee the body of man, and hear his voice, but cannot underſtand cleerly his mind or ſpeech, becauſe they are not endued with the ſame ſoule, with whoſe eyes they can be able ſo to perceive: likewiſe of the holy Scriptures (which are come forth for to inſtruct and<note n="q" place="margin">2.

Theſe things may be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red plainely by many oracles and examples, out of which I will produce ſome, that I may ſhew, that ſinne and mans wiſedome and the love of ones ſelfe, is the cauſe that men doe not underſtand Gods matters: and that by how much every one doth the further depart from theſe things, by ſo much is he the more <note n="z" place="margin">Ioh. 7.17.</note> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the things of God. Now the firſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt oracle is, that <hi>Adam</hi> afore he ſinned, had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12300:117"/>of GOD, and of divine things, ſo that hee gave names unto beaſts, unto every one according to his nature, and hee preſently knew the beginning of his wife, made of his rib he aſleepe, and<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 2.23.24.</note> propheſied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her. The ſame after he ſinned and followed the judgement and minde of the fleſh, fell into ſo great ignorance, that he would<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 3.8. Ier. 23.24. Heb. 4.13. Pſal. 139.7.</note> hide himſelfe among the trees from the ſight of God: which indeed was a very great blindneſſe, that he would hide from the eyes of God ſeeing all things. And what came to paſſe in <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſame alſo was done in his poſterity after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that if any were beleeving and obeying of God, thoſe God choſe and manifeſted his will unto them, but not to others. For an example is <hi>Enoch,</hi> who, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 5.22.</note> lived according to the wil of God, was taken up unto GOD; and <hi>Noah,</hi> being the moſt<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 6.9.</note> righteous of his time, God ſhewed unto him his purpoſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 6.13.17.18.</note> flood, a matter indeed of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which ſame thing alſo he did in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would ſhew unto him his will concerning Sodome and Gomorra, of which matter God himſelfe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this reaſon,<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 18.17.18.19.</note> ſaying, Shall I hide from <hi>Abraham</hi> the thing which I will doe? ſeeing that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall ſurely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him. For I know him, that he will command his children and his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, to doe juſtice and judgement, that the Lord may bring upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> that which hee hath ſpoken of him. The ſame did <hi>David</hi> write,<note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 25.9.12.13.14.</note> What man is he that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Lord? him will he teach in the way that hee ſhall chuſe: his ſoule ſhall dwell at eaſe, and his ſeed ſhall inherit the land.

The root of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is to feare the Lord, and the branches thereof are long life.

And after that the Prophet had inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the wickedneſſe of the Iſraelites, which was the cauſe that they could not underſtand divine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, thus he ſaith,<note n="p" place="margin">Iſa. 29.10.11.</note> For the Lord hath poured upon you die ſpirit of deepe ſleepe, and hath cloſed your

And the viſion of all is become unto you as the words of a booke that is ſealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, ſaying, Reade this, I pray thee: and he ſaith, I cannot, for it is ſealed.

Likewiſe in the new Teſtament the ſame things are delivered. CHRIST ſpake to them that were<note n="t" place="margin">Mar. 4.11.</note> without only in parables, that is, figuratively, and in covered words: but to his owne diſciples, that is, to beleevers, to the endued with<note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> charity, to the obedient, and to ſuch as followed him he<note n="w" place="margin">Mar. 4.34.</note> expounded all things afterward apart. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe finiſheth the whole matter in few words, ſaying,<note n="x" place="margin">1.

But the naturall man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. But he that is ſpirituall, jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth (or diſcerneth) all things. Out of theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places it appeareth; that the minde of God, and the ſecret counſailes lying hid in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are knowne to the faithfull onely, to the godly and religious, and to the endued with the ſpirit of God. For God is a King which manifeſteth his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12300:119"/>to none but to his faithfull friends, as we ſee the Kings of this world themſelves to doe. Therefore one may obſerve from the beginning of the world, that none except the godly have bin admitted into the counſell of God. Afore there was mentioned <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham:</hi> the ſame may one ſay concerning <hi>Iſaac, Iacob, Ioſeph, Moſes, Ioſhua, Samuel, David,</hi> and the other Prophets and Apoſtles ſervants of Chriſt, to whom whether they were learned or<note n="y" place="margin">Acts 4.13. 1. Cor. 1.26.27.28.</note> unlearned, God made manifeſt his will, and<note n="z" place="margin">Luke 24.45.</note> opened their mind for to underſtand the Scriptures. But the ungodly, and ſuch as<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 2.5.7.</note> rely on their owne judgement, although they underſtood all<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 7.48.49. Acts 17.18. 1. Cor. 2.6.7.8.</note> learning, never underſtood the ſpirit of the Scriptures, but rather perſecuted it, as <hi>Steven</hi> did upbraid unto them, ſaying: Yee ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked and uncircumciſed in heart and eares, yee doe alwayes<note n="c" place="margin">Acts. 7.51.</note> reſiſt the holy Ghoſt; as your Fathers did, ſo doe yee. And if ſo be that the ungodly have at any time prophecyed, or have ſpoken concerning divine and ſpirituall things, as did, <hi>Balaam, Saul, Caiphas,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees, yet they truly underſtood not the mind and ſpirit of God, but ſo ſpake of things unknowne unto themſelves, as if a French man hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Dutch man enditing words unto him, ſhould ſpeake in Dutch thoſe matters which himſelfe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not. CHRIST ſeemeth to declare this, where he ſaith:<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 23.2.3.</note> The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeate: what things they ſay, doe yee: for they ſay, and doe not. And concerning the ſame he ſaith elſewhere:<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 15.14.</note> Let them alone they are blinde and leaders of the blinde; and hee biddeth his people beware of their<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 16.6.</note> leaven. As if hee had ſaid this: In that they teach <hi>Moſes</hi>-his Laws, ye are to obey them: but in that they ſee not, but reject the minde and ſpirit of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:12300:119"/>which is uttered by me, they are blind. For examples ſake: <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote: Honour thy Father and thy Mother: this while they teach, they are to be obeyed. But when as they with their ſophiſtries doe deprave the ſame precept, and by their falſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous interpretation, draw away<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 15.5.6.</note> children from the true honouring of their parents, they are blinde and doe<note n="h" place="margin">Zeph. 3 4. 2. Cor. 2.17.</note> corrupt the commandement of God. The ſame while they teach, that ceremonies and ſacrifices are to be obſerved according to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, are to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: but while they reject me, who ſhew the mind and ſpirit of thoſe ceremonies and ſacrifices, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puffed up with a vaine (or unprofitable) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the letter doe too ſtiffely (or ſubbornely) hold to it, they refuſe the truth and ſenſe of the letter, and the will of God, and doe not<note n="i" place="margin">1.

Neither truly only doe not the ungodly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſpirit of God, but alſo if there be any one to whom there is given ſome knowledge of him, hee unleſſe hee endeavour diligently that hee may grow therein, loſeth that very knowledge, which he had: which very matter the Lord declareth, whiles he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the talent be taken away from him, which put it not to increaſe, and be given to him which hath ten. For to him which hath, it ſhall be given, and from him which hath not, even that very ſame which hee hath ſhall be<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 25.25.27 28.29.30.</note> taken away. The which we ſee came to paſſe unto <hi>Saul,</hi> who having the ſpirit of God, was<note n="m" place="margin">1.

Which things ſeeing they are ſo, all which would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their minds to the ſtudy of the holy Scriptures,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:12300:120"/>and to the knowing of Gods will, are to be exhorted, that they doe it in what way and in what manner it ought to bee done. Firſt that they<note n="o" place="margin">Luke 24.25. Ioh. 5 46.47.</note> beleeve thoſe things to bee true, which are written there: For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will beleeve, they ſhall not underſtand, but will account the holy Scriptures to be prophane. Then afterward (which alſo is the fruit of beleefe) that they ſubject their will to<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 7.17.</note> Gods will, ready to doe whatſoever God hath commanded, whether it bee ſweet or bitter, whether light or heavie, whether eaſie or hard. For that is the nature of faith (by which we muſt bee ſaved, and without which we cannot pleaſe God) that not only it doth juſtifie a man, and procure to him pardon of ſinnes through CHRIST; but alſo by cauſing to him a new<note n="q" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.17.</note> ſpirit, doth<note n="r" place="margin">Col. 1.13.</note> deliver him from the power of the devill, and ſet him at<note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 6.18 22.</note> liberty for the ſervice of God. Faith<note n="t" place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> purifieth the heart, and maketh a man of unjuſt to be juſt, of diſobedient obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, of carnall ſpirituall, of earthly heavenly, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly<note n="u" place="margin">1. Cor. 6.11.</note> godly: to be ſhort, of an old man and ſonne of darkneſs, it maketh a new creature and a ſon of<note n="w" place="margin">Eph. 5.8.</note> light, who caſting away the works of darkneſſe putteth on the armour of light, &amp; bringeth forth fruit unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, as afore he brought forth fruit unto unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. If then any one endued with this faith, mind and will, will come to the ſtudy of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, whether he be learned or unlearned, whether poore or rich, whether male or female, (for God hath no<note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 10.12. and 2.11.</note> reſpect of perſons) he ſhall truly underſtand them, and read them with fruit, and from thence ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come daily<note n="y" place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.3.

But if any one will obey his own will, and retaine humane, that is, fooliſh wiſdome, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:12300:120"/>not forſake his vices and ſins, but only either beleeve or performe, as much as ſhall like his luſt and fleſh, he being blinded through his owne corrupt will, ſhall not ſee the<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 3.3. 1 Cor. 2.14.</note> ſpirit of the holy Scriptures; and not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but drawing &amp;<note n="b" place="margin">2.

This we ſee came to paſſe unto the Scribes and Phariſees, who although they profeſſed the holy Scriptures, and were daily converſant in the ſtudy and reading of them, yet becauſe they would not<note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 3.18. Iſa. 55.7.</note> forſake their own underſtanding, vices and will, they erred ſo farre from the minde and ſpirit of them, that they crucified CHRIST the true and divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder of them: and this very ſame thing will come to paſſe unto all ſo affected and ſo diſpoſed as they were. Wherefore goe to now, O ye all which take thoſe holy bookes into your hands,<note n="g" place="margin">Ezech. 18.31.</note> caſt away pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane minds: beleeve God: forſake your owne will, and give over your ſelves, with a lowly, pliant, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and altogether<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 18.3.

               <hi>Q.</hi> May not any one attaine the underſtanding of the holy Scriptures, by conſidering the context, and by comparing place with place, &amp;c. without entring into ſuch a devoutneſſe of mind and life, as <hi>Caſtellio</hi> hath preſcribed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The comparing of one ſcripture with another, &amp;c. is profitable unto the more full perceiving of the deliverie of many points or matters; but there was never as yet any one, that could apprehend the great myſterie of godlineſſe, nor ever can any one poſſibly perceive the ſame by any endeavour whatſoever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he duely attend unto the interpretation delivered by the holy Fathers of the Church, and ſtrive to doe the whole will of God, and ſo become<note n="o" place="margin">See all ch. 48. of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Divinity.</note> enlightened by his holy ſpirit. The unexpreſſable diverſitie and contrariety of underſtanding of Gods matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into all they in theſe latter times have fallen, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually doe fall, which ſubmit not unto the guidance of the holy Fathers of the Church, but follow the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of their own minds, is a moſt manifeſt proof of the utter impoſſibility of knowing aright ſo much as the principles of Gods word, without having help of ſuch as are the guides in the Apoſtolicall Church, and without entring into ſuch an uprightneſſe of heart and converſation, as is afore declared requiſite to bee ſought after.</p>
